    <h3>Programming</h3>

    <p>Currently, most of the coding work I have done has been in classes. </p>
    <!--assembly and atari-->
    <h4>Assembly Language</h4>
    <p>In this class we learned how to create programs using Risc-V. We learned to code the Tower of Hanoi game and a number conversion from binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal. 
        It is a really hard language for those who are used to the way that you write with high-level languages. 
        It gives a lot of control, but it needs a line of code for every single movement it makes. One of the last assignments we made in the class was an atari game. 
        It was a group project. My group decided to go with a combination of Snake and Frogger. While it was never finished, we did get it to work to a certain extent. 
        Firstly, I created the sprite. It was an accident, but it became a frog-looking creature. The frog had to be able to move across the screen and collect little balls. 
        The balls would then spawn in a different spot once they interacted with the sprite. It took a lot of effort and late nights,
        but we eventually got the frog to be able to interact with the ball and move around on screen.</p>
    <p>The link for the assignments for this class can be found at this GitHub Repository.</p>
    <p>I am working my way through a Risc-V book on the language again, because while I didn't understand it then, I liked the language and simplicity through which everything worked. 
        It was hard to learn as there weren't many resources to be used. The resource we used the most was the online CREATOR compiler from GitHub. </p>
    <!--add link for compiler later-->
    <!--python-->
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>I went through all the basics of how to write in Python. Most of the assignments I have created will be available on my GitHub, but the notable projects 
        I have worked on creating a simple calculator, a simple web scraper, a GUI application, a simple chatbot, and a simple weather dashboard.
      During my Data Analytics class, we learned how to use Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, as well as web scrapers.

    </p><!--explain more in-depth about the small side projects from the book/-->

    <!--Java-->
    <!---Expalin about having learned the basics in this class, and pick up a book about it along with the gae development one we have already-->

    <!--C languages-->

<div id="web" class="tabcontent">

    <h3>Web Design</h3>

    <p>Web Development was the first programming I learned to do. I have spent a lot of time learning how to do a lot of things in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including this website.</p>
    <h4>This website</h4>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Advanced Web Development</h4>
    <h5>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h5>
    <p>add in bootscrap parts</p>
    <h5>React and Angular</h5>
    <p></p>
    <h5>Backend Languages</h5>
    <p></p>

    <h4>ANC Course</h4>
    <h5>Lizard Adoption</h5>
    <p>As another class project, the Adopt a Pet page is a simplistic page designed to convince my teacher to get a frilled-neck lizard as his next pet. It gives a species overview, care instructions, 
        behavior, and whether or not it was legal to own in the state of Arkansas. It includes text, hyperlinks, pictures, and a table. It is easy to see the improvement that I have made in this project.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h5>Blog</h5>
    <p>This project was part of a class assignment focused on learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The end goal was to create a website following the Dos and Don'ts my professor created. 
        I created a photography portfolio and blog.
      <br>It included a home page, an image gallery allowing you to move through the different topics and pictures available, an information page telling the tools I used, and a blog. 
        It is currently unfinished, but if I were to go back and finish it, it would have a working internal navigation for the blog page, better structure, and a lightbox functionality for the pictures.</p>

    <h3>Databases</h3>

    <p>I decided to take a class in my Associate's Degree about databases. It was mostly done in Access, but in the last month, we learned about MySQL. 
        I then took a course at SEMO learning more about the different types of databases.</p>

    <h3>Current Work</h3>

    <p>I like to challenge myself with different projects. When I hit a wall in my work, I like to see if taking a break will help me get a clearer head. By taking a break, 
        I mean I usually work on a different project in a different language. 
      A few of these projects haven't been started, but they've been planned out.
    </p>
    <h4>AWS class assignment</h4>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Media Game</h4>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Restaurant suggestions</h4>
    <p>This one has not been started, but my friends and I have been planning and talking about it for several months as a way to stop eating at the same restaurants every single time we go out to eat.</p>
