<P style="font-family:helvetica;"> Hello! I'm Sam, and the person who's photography and opinions you've been reading about. I'm not very complicated, and I really like all forms of art.</p>

<!--I'm still working out what looks best with my pictures-->
<h3 style="color:#3d3d00;"> Where you can find me on social media!</h3>
<p> I post all of my photos that I like to my social medias! Sure snapchat and facebook are good for posting to everyone, but Gurushots is MADE for photographers. Everyone starts out as a beginneron here, but the better you get and the more photos you have, the higher you can level.</p>

<h3 style="color:#3d3d00;">About my photography</h3>
<p>I take photos of animals, the people I love, point of views, the sky, and really just about anything that catches my eye! I have a few pictures that I'm eitehr very rpound of or just relly like on my information page, but you can find tons more in my <button onclick="document.location='gallery.htm'">gallery</button>.</P>
<p> I once won second place in a fair, but due to lack of time and covid, I have not been able to enter anything recently. I am not currently open for any picture taking as I'm doing school full-time along with a part-time job, but I appreciate all the people who've asked in the last couple of months.</p>
<p>You can find out about what technology I use in my <button onclick="document.location='infopg.htm'">information page</button> where I talk about the tips, tricks, and experiences I've had along my journey!
