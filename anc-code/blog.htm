<h1>Blog! Learn from my Mistakes</h1>
<p>I haven't been a photographer for years, but I have made a lot of mistakes. Also,I watch and read.</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>Welcome to my life updates that are sometimes about my photography and sometimes not.</h3>
<p>11/08/2021:Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something just because they think you're no good at it.</p>
<p> 09/26/2021: I'm currently struggling to think about how to put tables in this website, besides as a navigation bar and for pictures, but I have not yet finsihed editing and picking the pictures I wish to put on here, so I only have navigation bars. BUT! i have Five of those, so I think I've gotten somewhere here.</p>
<p>09/25/2021:The water pressure machine let out air and sounded like a chainsaw. at midnight. Alone at my house. Fun fact: I have been afraid of chainsaws since I once was chased by a clown holding one in a haunted house when i was like six.</p>
<h3>Decisions</h3>
<p>When I make decisions, I either am completely onboard and thought them through for months, or they were very spontaneous and I was stupid</p>
<p>My camera was not a very spontaneous event, because I thought about it for months, but I didn't think I was going to get one, so I never thought any farther than "I want a camera," and my reasons why. So the fact that I got a canon, was by complete chance. But it was a good chance, because it is amazing.</p>
<p>I don't always take my camera, but I plan out everything when I do, such as what i'll take pictures of and what I will go out of my way to find, like pinecones and where the sun is coming throught the trees.</p>

<h3>Framing</h3>
<p>Framing your pictures is avery serious ordeal.</p>
<p>So, depending on how your home looks and what you took a picture of, the frame has to go well, or else it is a dooming thing</p>
<p>I am here to guide youthrough absolutely nothing, but I can tell you what I do.</p>
<p>Everything I frame has a color that goes with the photo, like blue frames for my butterfly in the Animals gallery. Or black or rustic, because my home is old and very southern.</p>

<h3>Books</h3>
<p>I love to read. Usually. What I don't like is non-fiction, but i do sit through it when it has somethin i need, like research or tips.</p>
<p>This section is to relay all the tips and tricks I learn from the books I read. They may be about photography or they could just be about a fact i learned that you amy just need to know.</p>

<h3>Websites</h3>
<p>Some photography websites are really good, and I'll link you to a few that I think will help you. But there are a few that are bogus and you should stay away from because all they want is for you to buy somethbing from them.</p>
<p>Or maybe there will be no link, but there could be some things that I have from pdfs that come from other websites, and i will be crediting.</p>

<h3>Youtubers!</h3>
<p> Oh my. There are so many good youtubers or tiktokers even that can help or even motivate you to take pictures. There are definitely some that you need to folow or just browse throught to get some ideas.</p>
<p>You can even learn to take pictures off youtube. Who needs a class when you can sit and learn everyhting right off youtube. I will definitely be putting some helpful tutorials that i found.</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>We don't all know every function of every camera. There are even so many different atachments to learn about. I don't even know all the ends and outs of my camera, so it'll be a learning experience for all of us.</p>
<h3>Special Times</h3>
<p>I plan when I take my camera in advance. Is there soemthing that could happen? Are we taking our animals and can I get some great shots of them?</p>
<p>There is always a picture oppourtunity right beside you, but you can't always have your camera, so plan in advance.</p>
<p>This comin november, I will be in the deer woods, so I have already planned in advance to take my camera to get some amazing shots of all my animals.</p>
<h3>Posing</h3>
<p>Lighting and the subject aren't all theyre cracked up to be. Sure, they're important, but for them to be good, you have to learn how to make them good.</p>
<p>Posing is such an intricate part. Every piece of your body is a part of your photo, so how it's presented is very important.</p>
<p>Besides! If you feel confident when in a photo, it'll show and your picture will be so much better.</p>
<h3>Where to Buy</h3>
<p>Everything is so expensive now. YOu can't buy everything brand new. But, every placve will offer you a different price for something, it just takes a little research.</p>
<p>We're going to go over where I look to buy extensions and attachments or even an camera!</p>
<h3>When I Take Pictures</h3>
<p>I prefer not to take pictures during the night or even planning them.</p>
<p>I like to take sponateous moment catching one. Where everyone is showing actual emotions, but that's not for everyone.</p>
<p>But, this website is about me, so everytime I take a really good spur of the moment one, I'll describe it here for you.</p>
<h3>Miscellanious</h3>
<p>Like in the gallery, not everything has a specific place, so it needs one.</p>
