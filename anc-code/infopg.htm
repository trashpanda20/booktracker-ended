<h1 style="color:darkseagreen;">What I Take </h1>

<h2>Websites for better knowldge on what you can use</h2>
<a href = "https://www.vandelaydesign.com/online-photo-editing/" target="_blank"> Editing</a><br />
<p>For this, just use what you find works great for you. Sure those super expensive ones work really well, but you can get the same things from a limited version. I have been using PhotoScapeX when on my computer. Using editing apps on your phone is okay too! If you want to use Snapchat, use Snapchat. I like this new app i found just recently called Prequel on the App Store.</p>
<p>There are such good apps on the app store to use, especially becasue your phone is what you take selfies with so it's got more geared towards it. FAcetune is one I've seen a lot of people use, but I never have. It all comes down to what your strengthsw are and what you're willing to pay. I somestimes use a drawing software called Krita, becasue I have a drawing tablet and pen that makes it a lot easier. Honestly, I tried quite a few PC versions, but I have always found that I like the Mobile versions better, but PhotoSCape X has been very good to me for these past couple months.</p>
<!--MAybe go back and explain what I use and why somewher in future. Explain the ones I've used andwhy i liked them or didnt-->
